1
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,842
<i>Report
to your stations immediately.</i>

2
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,566
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

3
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:47,723
<i>We are under attack!</i>

4
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,090
<i>We are under attack!</i>

5
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:54,489
- Shit!
- Language!

6
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:56,206
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

7
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:57,649
<i>The central building is</i>

8
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,288
<i>protected by some kind
of energy shield.</i>

9
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond</i>

10
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,524
<i>any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

11
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:08,932
Loki's sceptre must be here.

12
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,442
Strucker couldn't
mount this defence without it.

13
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,732
At long last.

14
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,409
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

15
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,848
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

16
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,609
Wait a second.
No one else is gonna deal with the fact

17
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:40,526
that Cap just said "Language"?

18
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,207
I know.

19
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:49,529
 Just slipped out.

20
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,366
Who gave the order to attack?

21
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,769
<i>Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.</i>

22
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,766
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

23
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:04,845
They have to be after the sceptre.

24
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,449
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

25
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,166
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

26
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,211
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

27
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,683
A hit may make them close ranks.

28
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,125
Everything we've accomplished...

29
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,603
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.

30
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,406
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

31
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,206
Send out the twins.

32
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,291
It's too soon.

33
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,530
It's what they signed up for.

34
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,005
My men can hold them.

35
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,531
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

36
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:47,884
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

37
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,692
Send in the Iron Legion.

38
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,493
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>
